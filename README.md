# bloxstrapx

BloxstrapX is a third-party ROBLOX modification that does not interact with the standard Roblox bootstrapper, but does provide additional useful features and improvements.
It is not designed to take away from Bloxstrap, the original project, but merely port some of the features over to MacOS devices.

## Features
BloxstrapX is nowhere near ready to release to you guys as of yet. But I will keep you in the loop here.
Here is a list of what I intend to provide by the time I release:

- Flag support.
- Modding stuff such as death sound, cursors and textures.
- Graphics settings and modifications.
- Options to enable features unavailable or hidden on Mac.

## Installing
When we release, installing should be as simple as dragging BloxstrapX to your Applications folder and launching.
